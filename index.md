## Questions

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
One of the most interesting topics I've explored this quarter is the use of blockchain in the storing of information. This utilizes the blockchain properties of immutability and persistence. I enjoyed exploring into how these properties can be leveraged to create a reliable and secure way to store information, such as buyer, seller, property, amount, and other information key to real estate transactions. The ability to maintain an unalterable record over time makes blockchain an invaluable tool for ensuring data integrity in various applications, especially for our project attempting to provid some alternative to current real estate practice.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
For my Quarter 2 Project, I would like to investigate the potential use of a public testnet, as opposed to a local one like Ganache, to simulate transactions in a more realistic environment. Currently, our transactions are instantainious and do not actually exchange any currency other than a simple counter. Specifically, I am interested in exploring the use of a Bitcoin side chain. Here, we would use a public testnet set up for developers to test their application, while also having a currency that is indeed live but not of any real money value. Using a public testnet could provide more accurate insights into how our transactions would function in a final, end user, product and how smart contracts behave in a decentralized, live environment. Both of which would be appealing to have in a presentation, as opposed to just a locally running application.

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
In our current Quarter 1 Project, we are heavily focused on implementing smart contracts. However, in the next quarter, we would like to shift our attention towards developing the user side of the product. Specifically, we aim to make the application not just useful in theory with blockchain interactions, but usable by regular people. One of these tasks would include implementing a usable title search feature in some mobile app as an incentive to get users to use our app. This would be appealing in our final presentation as we wont just have a theoretical prototype or a jumbled mess, but a nice usable product.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
Our project currently uses blockchain to emulate real estate transactions, but we plan to enhance user engagement by implementing a token or coin system. Users would be able to collect or earn these tokens through interactions with the application, such as verifying new properties placed by sellers and confirming their existence. This token-based reward system would create an incentive for users to actively participate and help ensure the accuracy and legitimacy of the property listings in the application. In addition to implementing a token-based reward system, we are also interested in adding a geolocation feature to assist in the confirmation of these properties. our real estate application.
